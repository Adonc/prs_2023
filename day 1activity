Write SNP list and extract SNPs

1. You will now use the information that you found on the PLINK website to create a command to extract a list of SNPs. Below is a list of requirements - try to do this before you go to the end of this section, where the full command is given and explained.

    Set the D1D binary file as input ===> --bfile D1D

    Set MAF threshold to 0.05 ===> --maf 0.05

    Set SNP missingness threshold to 0.05 ===>- -geno 0.05

    Add the appropriate command to write out a snp list containing only those SNPs with MAF above 0.05 and missingness below 0.05  ==> --write-snplist

    Use ‘D1D_snps’ as the output file name ==> --out D1D_snps

    After the command has run, check the output for your SNP list and look at it with the default viewer.


  2. You will now use the SNP list that you have created to extract those SNPs and create a new set of data files in a single command.

    Use the D1D binary file set as input ===> --bfile D1D

    Find the command for extracting a set of SNPs listed in a file (hint: Data Management section) and combine it with a command that you learned above to create binary files ===> --extract D1D_snps.snplist

    Use the output file name ‘D1D_MAF_MISS’ ===> 
  complete code for 2 >>>  plink --bfile D1D --extract D1D_snps.snplist --make-bed --out D1D_MAF_MISS

  Individual missingness
  1 and 2. plink --bfile D1D --missing --out D1D_miss
  snp missingness
  2 the outpu files, lmiss conains information of snp missingness 
  Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
  code ===> plink --bfile D1D --hardy --out D1D_hardy
  Allele frequencies
  plink --bfile D1D --freq --out D1D_freq
Apply individual missingness thresholds
